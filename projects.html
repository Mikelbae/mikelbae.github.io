                <h2>Campus Friend Finder App (Project Lead)</h2>
                <p>
                    A full-stack web application designed to solve student isolation by connecting users for activities that require partners, like squash or tennis. It also allowed campus clubs to host events and gauge attendance interest.

                    <li><strong>Activity Management:</strong> Users can create detailed event requests (time, location, participant limits) that others can request to join.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> Interest-based matching and customized profiles with Cloudinary image integration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Technical Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    As Project Lead, I conceptualized the application's core functionality. on the technical side, I architected the real-time group chat system, handling dynamic WebSocket connections and message storage in MongoDB. I also implemented the secure authentication flows and integrated Cloudinary for handling user-uploaded profile media.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, WebSockets (Socket.io), Cloudinary API, HTML/CSS</p>

                <h2>Line-Following Autonomous Vehicle (MARV)</h2>
                <p>
                    An autonomous robot designed from scratch to navigate complex tracks by following specific colored lines (red, green, blue, or black), even when paths overlapped.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Key Features & Hardware</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Custom Sensor Array:</strong> Designed and built a 5-phototransistor array with RGB LEDs to detect color based on reflected voltage levels (ADC).</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Hardware Build:</strong> Designed the PCB, modeled and 3D-printed the custom chassis, and integrated N20 motors with an H-bridge for precise PWM control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assembly Programming:</strong> Entire control logic and sensor processing were written in low-level Assembly for the PIC18F45K22 microcontroller.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Technical Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    I co-developed the core navigation logic in Assembly, translating raw ADC sensor data into motor control signals. I also implemented UART communication to debug and display real-time data about the car's vision state and driving decisions.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Assembly Language, PIC18F45K22 Microcontroller, PCB Design, 3D Printing, UART, ADC, PWM</p>

            <div class="project-card">
                <h2>Maze-Navigating Autonomous Vehicle (MARV)</h2>
                <p>
                    An advanced autonomous robot powered by an ESP32 that navigated a color-coded maze according to predefined rules, featuring a custom web dashboard for real-time diagnostics.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Key Features & Subsystems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>State-Based Navigation:</strong> The robot followed complex logic rules based on wall color (e.g., turning 90° for blue/black walls, passing through green "doors," stopping at red).</li>
                    <li><strong>Angle Correction:</strong> The color sensor array calculated the angle of incidence to self-correct if the robot approached a line at an angle greater than 5 degrees.</li>
                    <li><strong>SOS Pure Tone Detection:</strong> A custom analog circuit (microphone, biquad filter, Schmitt triggers, RC low-pass) that detected a specific 2kHz emergency frequency to trigger an interrupt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Diagnostics:</strong> A Wi-Fi-enabled web app displayed real-time states, wheel speeds, and sensor data, and allowed for remote state transitions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Technical Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed the System Navigation Control (SNC), the "mind" of the robot, which processed sensor data to determine state transitions (Idle, Calibrate, Maze, SOS) and motor commands. I also designed and built the analog circuitry for the 2kHz SOS detection system and created rigorous Quality Test Procedures (QTPs) to fine-tune the logic.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> C++, ESP32, Analog Circuit Design (Filters, Op-Amps), HTML/JS (for dashboard)</p>
