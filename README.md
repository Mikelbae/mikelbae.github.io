## About This Project

This website serves as my professional portfolio, a personal sandbox for coding experiments, and a showcase of my skills in front-end development. It was built to be clean, interactive, and demonstrate a blend of professional presentation with personal creativity.

## Key Features

* **Cinematic Intro:** A "Click to Enter" screen that triggers a multi-second animated intro with sound effects, built with CSS animations and JavaScript.

    * An advanced D&D dice roller with support for multiple dice types, modifiers, and average-roll calculation.
    * A real-time text analysis tool (character, word, sentence counter).
    * A speed typing test.
    * A speech jammer (Delayed Auditory Feedback) experiment using the Web Audio API.
* **Easter Egg:** A hidden DVD-style screensaver easter egg (the Toto Wolff button) that triggers a "digital rain" effect and sound.
